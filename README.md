# matasono_crypto
Code for the matasano crypto challenges. C-language.

1. Hex to Base64
  I take the a hex string and convert it into a binary string. Then every six bits I convert them into
  into decimal. Each decimal is matched to its corresponding base64 character. Then all the characters
  are concatenated.
